self reflection:

As soon as I moved past the first hurdle, I felt I moved at a much faster and deliberate pace. The first thing to do was set up the database and connect our front end to it. We had never done this before, so therefore it was quite a challenge, but as soon as that hurdle was passed, it was business as usual. I felt like I was hurrying at times, which is not necessary, I must remember that this, and life in general, is a marathon and not a sprint (if life is a race that is, which it isn’t, but that’s another topic of discussion). 
I appreciate I took the time to workout the method of approach first before each new functionality and then implement it. It gave me a clear and stress free head. I feel much more confident now for the real assessment coming up. Tomorrow I will incorporate new features and see If I can debug some small things. After that I want to rebuild the app from scratch to better understand what is going on. Also take a look at Rein’s code to see how he did it. 
Sounds like a good plan. 
So overall, very satisfied with myself and confident for the future. 

I came back and updated all kinds of errors and bugs and gave myself the 60 points deserved.
